1.0 Introduction
***************************************************************
If you are a first time user of Microsoft XML Diff and Patch, 
read the documentation. The conceptual material in the 
documentation is written to provide quick start to new users.

The tool is provided as is. 

-------------------------------
1.1 Guidelines
-------------------------------

* Changing diffgrams created by the tool is not recommended. 
The tool might not be able to patch the original file if 
the diffgram is modified.

* Relying on diffgrams generated by the tool directly (e.g. 
reading them in a program and doing operations based on the
information in the diffgrams) is not recommended. Microsoft
reserves the right to change the diffgram format without 
notice.

2.0 Installing the Microsoft XML Diff and Patch 1.0
***************************************************************
The original installer (xmldiffgui.msi) was installed using Windows Installer 2.0.
But this sinstallation did not contain the source code for the libraries - which
was provided in a completely separate installer (XmlDiffPatch.exe).

But this installer (XmlDiffPatch.exe) refused to install if .NET v1.1 is not present,
which made it difficult to install on Windows 7 or later.

This Github repository is intended to solve dificulty, and restructures the projects
in a sensible structure for rebuilding using Visual Studio 2010 (or later).


-----------------------
2.1 System Requirements
-----------------------
* The original Microsoft supplied package/tool required Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0,
but the new re-worked package requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 

-----------------------
2.2 Repository structure

The files are provided in the directory structure required to build the projects.
All necessary files are included to build the binaries:
